## Grok3 Breakout game

I used Grok3 and uses these prompts

```
How about a colored version of Breakout? Make it run inside HTML/Javascript, make the paddle be controlled by mouse or A and D keys. Put in a score, give the player 3 lives

When the user loses, it tells them with Game Over, but does it in a loop, going to 0, -1, -2 lives etc

Sometimes when the ball hits the bat, it slides horizontally along the bat

Put in a pause button, that will toggle the game activity

```

I got index.html out of it
